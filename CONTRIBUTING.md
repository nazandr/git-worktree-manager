## üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute

### Bug Reports

When filing a bug report, please include:

- **Environment details**: OS, shell version, Git version
- **Steps to reproduce**: Clear, numbered steps
- **Expected behavior**: What should happen
- **Actual behavior**: What actually happens
- **Error messages**: Full error output if applicable

### Feature Requests

For feature requests, please provide:

- **Use case**: Why is this feature needed?
- **Proposed solution**: How should it work?
- **Alternatives considered**: Other approaches you've thought about
- **Additional context**: Screenshots, examples, etc.

### Code Contributions

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicate work
2. **Create an issue** to discuss major changes before implementation
3. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
4. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
5. **Test thoroughly** on your local setup
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

## üîß Coding Standards

### Shell Script Guidelines

- **Use bash-specific features** when they improve readability
- **Follow naming conventions**:
  - Functions: `snake_case`
  - Variables: `snake_case` 
  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE`
- **Add comments** for complex logic
- **Use meaningful variable names**
- **Handle errors gracefully** with proper exit codes

### Code Style

```bash
# Good: Clear function with error handling
create_worktree() {
    local branch_name="$1"
    local worktree_type="${2:-feature}"
    
    if [[ -z "$branch_name" ]]; then
        log_error "Branch name is required"
        return 1
    fi
    
    # Implementation...
}

# Good: Clear variable names and error checking
if ! git rev-parse --git-dir > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    log_error "Not in a git repository"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Documentation

- **Update README.md** for user-facing changes
- **Update help text** in the script for new commands
- **Add inline comments** for complex algorithms
- **Update CHANGELOG.md** for all changes

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

Test your changes across different scenarios:

```bash
# Test in a real git repository
cd /path/to/test-repo

# Test basic functionality
./git-worktree-manager.sh create test/branch
./git-worktree-manager.sh list
./git-worktree-manager.sh switch test-repo-test-branch
./git-worktree-manager.sh remove test-repo-test-branch

# Test edge cases
./git-worktree-manager.sh create "feature/with spaces"
./git-worktree-manager.sh create "feature/with/slashes"

# Test error conditions
./git-worktree-manager.sh create  # No branch name
./git-worktree-manager.sh switch nonexistent  # Invalid worktree
```

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Commands work in different git repositories
- [ ] Branch names with special characters are handled
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] VS Code integration works properly
- [ ] Zsh completion functions correctly
- [ ] Configuration changes are respected
